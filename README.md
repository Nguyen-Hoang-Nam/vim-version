# version.vim

Check for outdated dependencies is one of the most important things to keep the projects safe. Inspirated by Version lens in Visual Studio Code, I make the small plugin to fetch versions from package manager and replace replace previous version.

Currently, I only support Javascript modules.

## Installation

### Using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)

```vim
Plug 'Nguyen-Hoang-Nam/vim-version'
```

## Commands

| Command | List |
| :LVersions | Get the lastest version ('-r' to replace)
